`(\( ' v ' )/)`

hey what's up

it's easier for me to throw these files on github instead of losing them all the time, so enjoy them! they're under the [mit license](license.md), so just remember to keep that copyright notice in most things or something. talk to your ~~doctor~~ lawyer.

ideally, this is system agnostic, but here's a list of configurations that i'm using and why i'm using them: 

<!-- todo: add more programs -->

|program|purpose|file(s)|link|
|---|---|---|---|
|`alacritty`|terminal emulator|[`alacritty/alacritty.conf`](alacritty/alacritty.conf)|[🔗](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
|`sway`|wayland tiling window manager|[`sway/config`](sway/config)|[🔗](https://github.com/swaywm/sway)|
|`mako`|wayland notification daemon|[`mako/config`](mako/config)|[🔗](https://github.com/emersion/mako)|
|`wofi`|dmenu alternative|`included with sway`|[🔗](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi)|
|`ulauncher`|modern application launcher|[`included with sway`|[🔗](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher)

i'll eventually write some more documentation.

* [stable](https://github.com/takouhai/dotfiles/tree/stable) is the most recent configuration that i deemed "worthy to ship".
* [dev](https://github.com/takouhai/dotfiles/tree/dev) is my current "bleeding edge" configuration that i update often. no promises on that one working. good luck!
