`(\( ' v ' )/)`

hey what's up

it's easier for me to throw these files on github instead of losing them all the time, so enjoy them!

i'll eventually write some more documentation.

* [stable](https://github.com/takouhai/dotfiles/tree/stable) is the most recent configuration that i deemed "worthy to ship".
* [dev](https://github.com/takouhai/dotfiles/tree/dev) is my current "bleeding edge" configuration that i update often. no promsies on that one working. good luck!
