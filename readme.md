`(\( ' v ' )/)`

hey what's up

it's easier for me to throw these files on github instead of losing them all the time, so enjoy them! they're under the [mit license](LICENSE.md), so just remember to keep that copyright notice in most things or something. talk to your ~~doctor~~ lawyer.

ideally, this is system agnostic, but here's a list of configurations that i'm using and why i'm using them: 

<!-- todo: add more programs -->

|program|purpose|file(s)|
|-------|-------|-------|
|`dunst`|notification manager|`dunst/dunstrc`|

i'll eventually write some more documentation.

* [stable](https://github.com/takouhai/dotfiles/tree/stable) is the most recent configuration that i deemed "worthy to ship".
* [dev](https://github.com/takouhai/dotfiles/tree/dev) is my current "bleeding edge" configuration that i update often. no promises on that one working. good luck!
